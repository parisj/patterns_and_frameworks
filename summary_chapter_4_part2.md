# Chapter 4: Architectural Patterns

We continue describing the patterns mentioned in chapter 4 of the book Fault Tolerance.

## Someone in charge
### Intro

Anything can go wrong, even during error processing. When this happens the system might stop doing the error processing in addition to not doing the normal processing.

### Problem

Detection is hard; recovery is also hard. Within the world of fault tolerance, there are two kinds of detection:
1. Detecting the actual error
2. Detecting the part of the system that has failed silently 

If that part of the system knows what should be happening, then the system is robust and it can fix the problem by itself or report it to the *FAULT OBSERVER* 

If something does not work there must be part of the system that can restart processing actions to resolve the situation.
